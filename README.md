# T3
YRTL-T3, the NRF24 remote control for various YRTLBots

Similar to an R/C remote (in fact, with parts  pilfered from old R/C gear), T3 uses an el-cheapo NRF24L01+ radio to send stick and button positions to whichever robot it's talking to at the time.

Uses MikeM's [RadioHead](http://www.airspayce.com/mikem/arduino/RadioHead/index.html) library to get the nrf24 talking, and a V1 [TFT Touch Shield](http://www.seeedstudio.com/wiki/2.8%27%27_TFT_Touch_Shield_V1.0) to display stuff.
